# Task Board Dev Test

This project is a dev test to create a minimal task board using this [API](https://task-api.learninbit.app/redoc/). Live example can be found at [https://learninbit.cltdev.com](https://learninbit.cltdev.com).

## Task Requirements

1. Create a simple React/Vite/Next.js app using Tailwind CSS to manage tasks and task categories.
2. Do not use a component library (e.g., Material UI, Ant Design, etc.).
3. Refer to the API docs provided (link will be in the email) to understand available APIs.
4. Use JWT Auth.

## Submission Guidelines
- Code quality
- Reusability of components
- Data fetching logic
- UI design

NOTE: Use the meta field available in tasks and task categories to store persistent data. For example, you can use creativity for persistent colors and icons for a task category, or define a "priority", etc.
